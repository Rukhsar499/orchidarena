                <p className="mb-4">At PSM Turf, we strive to ensure every player&apos;s experience is smooth, fair, and enjoyable. We would like your booking experience to be as easy and hassle-free as possible, so you can enjoy what really counts — playing football and making memories with your team.</p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Booking & Payments</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">Every booking needs to have at least two consecutive slots. Bookings can be easily made online by choosing your desired location, date, and time. You can pay the full amount or make a part payment, which instantly books your slot. Kindly remember that the balance must be paid before entering the turf. Once the payment is made, you&apos;ll get a confirmation message with all your booking information.</p>



                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Cancellations & Rescheduling</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    We know things change. You can cancel or rearrange your booking 24 hours before your booked starting time. Cancellations beyond this time will incur partial or total loss of your booking fee. Rearranging is possible on a slot-available basis, and our staff will help you find the next best alternative.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Arrival & Conduct</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Kindly come at least 10–15 minutes before your slot. Late clients may risk losing playing time, as the next client will start on time. A no-show may result in the cancellation of your booking without a refund.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Our turfs are intended for football only. Players are asked to wear proper football cleats and treat the turf and equipment with care. Any damage or misconduct can incur penalties or the refusal of future bookings.

                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Refunds & Safety</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">In the event of cancellations or rearrangements by PSM Turf owing to maintenance, weather, or technical problems, players are entitled to a full refund or can opt to play in another slot. Refunds are made through the same payment method and can take a few working days.
                    Players play at their own risk, and PSM Turf does not take responsibility for injury or loss of personal property.</p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    We’re here to make your game memorable, safe, and full of energy.
