        <p className="mb-4">Your privacy is important to us at PSM Turf. When you make a booking for a game, get in touch with us, or visit our website, we want you to feel comfortable and reassured that your personal details are safe. This policy details what we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have over the data.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">1. Information We Collect</h2>
       <p className="mb-4">When you are in touch with us — say, when you reserve a slot or reach out to our staff — we might gather:</p>
       <ul className="mb-6">
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Contact Information:</b> Name, telephone number, e-mail</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Booking Information:</b> Date, time, turf location, and payment</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Technical Data:</b> Type of device used, IP address, browser type, and usage patterns</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Voluntary Information:</b> Messages or feedback you wish to send</li>
       </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">We collect this data to validate your bookings, get in touch with you, and improve your gaming experience.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">2. How We Use and Share Data</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            Your data is used to keep track of bookings, send reminders, process payments, and offer support. We could pass limited information to trusted service providers (such as payment gateways or hosting partners) or the law enforcement authorities if mandated by law. We never sell your personal data.

        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">3. Data Protection and Storage Information</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            You can access your personal data, change it, or delete it at any time. You can also object to processing or withdraw consent by contacting privacy@psmturf.com.
         </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">5. Updates & Contact</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">We can revise this policy as our services change. If you have any concerns or questions, write to privacy@psmturf.com</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Your trust is what guides everything we do — on and off the field — at PSM Turf.
